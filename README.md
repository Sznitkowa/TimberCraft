Dear User! 👋🏻

This repo contains the code of my private, non-commercial project: https://sznitkowa.github.io/TimberCraft/.
The website was created for a potential customer who runs a business and wants to advertise handmade wood products.
I created the website mockup from scratch in figma, came up with the company name and the whole concept.
I wanted the site to be user friendly and easy to use and to encourage to contact with the maker of wooden products and to expand his audience through the site.

Have a nice day! 🌞
